Data Analytics project showcasing  customer behavior analysis using Python , SQL and Power BI
📊 Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis & Dashboard
1️⃣ Overview

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end Data Analytics workflow — from raw data loading to interactive dashboard reporting.

The objective of this project was to:

Load and analyze a dataset using Python

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Clean and transform data for accuracy

Run SQL queries in PostgreSQL for structured analysis

Build an interactive Power BI dashboard

Generate a professional report

Create a presentation (PPT) using Gamma

This project highlights practical skills in data handling, analysis, visualization, and reporting.

2️⃣ Dataset

The dataset contains structured business-related data (e.g., customers, transactions, performance metrics).

Data includes numerical, categorical, and date-based columns.

Data was imported in CSV format and processed using Python and PostgreSQL.

Key focus areas:

Missing values handling

Data type corrections

Duplicate removal

Feature engineering

Aggregated metrics for reporting
